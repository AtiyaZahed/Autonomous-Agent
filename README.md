# Autonomous-Agent
The code includes the deep reinforcement learning part of the autonomous agent.
A task class is the function, and an environment class is the terminal, edge, and cloud devices.
A class for generating functions from different devices is created explicitly with a predetermined lambda, and the agent places them based on priority.
All classes and variables are named so that the code is straightforward.
Some values ​​are fixed and can be read from the file.
